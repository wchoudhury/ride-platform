/**
 * \brief Issue: Fork in multi-threaded programs can lead to problems, e.g. when malloc is used, 
 * and we do not have full control over all used libraries (e.g. for DDS).
 * 
 * Solution: Fork before all other parts of the LCC executable are initalized. This gives us a child
 * process with minimal content, created when no threads are running. This child process can then be
 * communicated with to fork from it to execute other programs, like the labcam, simulated vehicles 
 * etc. This class bundles the creation of this child with messaging, to let the child create further
 * child processes to execute other programs. Its destructor also makes sure that (in case the LCC
 * is terminated normally) the child is waited for after destruction, so that it does not remain as
 * a zombie process. The same goes for the message queue.
 * 
 * NOTE: This class CANNOT use the CPM Logger or any other CPM function. If it does, the above errors
 * are not resolved and the class becomes meaningless!
