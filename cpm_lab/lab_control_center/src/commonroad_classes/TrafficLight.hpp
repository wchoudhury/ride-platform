//Optional is used for 3 reasons:
//1. Some values are optional according to the specification
//2. Some values might be missing if the file is not spec-conform, which is easy to handle when we do not require that they exist (though we still check for their existance)
//3. It is easier to set up an object piece by piece in the constructor, but that is not possible if the member object we want to set up does not have a default constructor (we would have to use the initializer list then)
