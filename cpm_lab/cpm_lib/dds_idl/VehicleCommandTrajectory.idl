 * \struct VehicleCommandTrajectory
 * \brief Trajectory sent to a vehicle; the vehicle should ideally follow this trajectory, if it is not outdated and already valid
 * 
 * The vehicle has feedback controllers for both longitudinal and 
 * lateral motion which keep it on the given reference trajectory.
 * The reference trajectory is a continuous function of time. It is
 * defined as a Cubic Hermite spline, which is constructed by points and
 * segments between consecutive points. The reference trajectory can be
 * extended with new segments while the controller is using it, like this:
 *         https://i.imgur.com/vp4PQ7C.gif
 * Each point in the trajectory is described by a TrajectoryPoint struct.
 * TrajectoryPoints may be sent in any order and may be repeated. A repeated
 * TimeStamp in a TrajectoryPoint will overwrite the existing TrajectoryPoint 
 * with the same TimeStamp.
 *     The current segment is defined by the newest TrajectoryPoint in the past
 * and the oldest TrajectoryPoint in the future. If the current segment is
 * unavailable the vehicle will brake and stop. 
 *     The selection of TrajectoryPoints and the interpolation is done based 
 * on the local clock on the vehicle. Thus, the user must ensure that their 
 * clock is synchronized, or account for clock offsets.
 *     The user should ensure that the duration, distance and speed in a 
 * trajectory segment are plausible in relation to each other. A poor choice of
 * trajectory parameters may lead to physically impossible curvatures and
 * accelerations. The trajectory interpolation formulas can be found in
 *     rti_raspberry/src/TrajectoryInterpolation.cxx
