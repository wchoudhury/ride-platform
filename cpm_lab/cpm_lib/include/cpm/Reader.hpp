     * \class Reader
     * \brief Creates a DDS Reader that, on request, returns 
     * the newest valid received sample according to the 
     * timestamp of the DDS type T and the current time. Use this reader if 
     * a synchronous use of samples is desired, within the domain
     * of ParticipantSingleton.
     * This reader uses a buffer that holds the latest
     * samples. Any used DDS type is required to 
     * include the Header.idl: It contains timestamps that specify 
     * from when on a sample is valid (valid_after_stamp) 
     * and a stamp for when a sample was created (create_stamp). 
     * These stamps are used to find the newest 
     * sample (using create_stamp) that 
     * is valid (using valid_after_stamp) according 
     * to the current system time. Once the Reader is 
     * created, it can be used anytime to retrieve the 
     * newest valid sample, if one exist.
